# Street Life: implementation and visual rules

Read this file before changing the project. For mechanics, schedules and current
content, also consult [GAME_DESIGN.md](GAME_DESIGN.md). Preserve existing game
behavior during visual changes: pause rules, time multipliers, saved progress,
focus, navigation blocking and delayed stat animations are part of the product.

## Use the existing design system

- Use the system sans-serif family and existing `--font-*`, `--weight-*`,
  `--text-*` and semantic color variables in `src/styles.css`.
- Exactly three text roles: Small = 14px; Body = 16px; Title = 20px below 768px
  and 24px at/above 768px. Use variables, never a new numeric text size or a
  screen-specific font family. Icon/art geometry is independent of text size.
- Main narrative, action labels and confirmation buttons use Body. Narrative is
  regular 400 and primary text; modal narratives use `modal-narrative`.
  Card/item names are semibold 600; hints, times, hours, prices, descriptions of
  services and metadata are Small in secondary/muted text. Titles use Title/600.
- Keep charcoal surfaces, off-white primary text and cool gray secondary text.
  Positive sage is `--color-positive` (#7f9b87); warning/selected ochre is
  `--color-warning` (#af9868). Use their surface/border tokens. Preserve the
  established red critical/negative indicators and capacity hatching.

## Templates to reuse

| Interface | Required template/reference |
| --- | --- |
| Any modal backdrop | `ModalOverlay` from `src/Modal.tsx` |
| Modal frame | `ModalPanel`: regular 480px or compact 408px |
| Confirm/cancel/destructive button | `ModalAction`: primary, secondary or danger |
| Travel, internet search or call in progress | `ActivityDialog` (`kind="travel"` or `kind="phone"`); elapsed/phase text uses `ActivityStatus` |
| Authored event, with or without an illustration | `EventDialog`; use its `EventFrame` / `EventBody` for another event presentation |
| Rain choices and waiting under cover | `RainEventDialog`, built on `EventFrame` / `EventBody` |
| Sleep duration and wake-time planning | `SleepPlanningDialog` |
| Event answer / action / transport / search / sleep option | `ChoiceButton`, grouped with `ChoiceOptions` |
| Finished action / discovery / illustrated outcome | `ResultCard` |
| Inventory choice or confirmation | `InventoryDialog`, `FoodChoiceDialog`, `DiscardDialog` |
| Phone app and header | `PhoneScreen` |
| Location illustration and description | `LocationSummary` / `ShopHero` in `LocationPresentation.tsx` |
| Item cards | `InventorySlot` and `ShopCard`; Backpack is the typography reference |
| Stat bars and animated changes | `Stat`, including the existing delay and cap display |
| Contour icons / location icons | `Icon`, `locationIcon`, existing icon names |

`src/modal.css` is the single visual contract for modal backgrounds, borders,
radius, shadow, safe-area gutters, padding, narrative text and action buttons.
Use its `--modal-*`, `--control-*` and `--choice-*` variables. The common frame
uses #191e21, border #4a5155, 18px radius, 5px blur and rgba(4,7,10,.62) backdrop.
Do not duplicate these properties in individual dialog selectors or append a
stronger CSS override to repair one screen. Change the shared rule or introduce
an explicit reusable variant with a documented purpose. Keep stacking order and
each dialog's interaction lifecycle in its existing owner.

The extracted dialogs above are presentation components (v325). `App.tsx` owns
timers, visibility/pause rules, saved pending events, choice eligibility, seeded
ordering inputs, dice/outcome handling and sleep duration/wake calculations.
Pass calculated data and handlers to the template; do not duplicate its markup
inside `App.tsx` or start a second timer inside a dialog. Preserve the existing
modal refs so focus and keyboard behavior keep working. `ResultCard` remains
the shared screen for completed events/actions and information discoveries.

Scenes with illustrations and their results share the regular frame, 16:9 art
flush with its top/side edges, and the same inner horizontal padding. Compact
confirmations/timers use the compact frame. Content layout can differ by purpose;
the surface and typography must remain consistent. Long content must scroll
inside the panel with controls reachable. Keep reduced-motion behavior.

Choice cards have one 24px neutral contour icon on the left, Body/400 copy,
Small details and a right-aligned duration. Use one column on all viewports.
Round displayed approximate durations to 5 minutes via `approximateDuration`;
do not round actual timers, opening hours or gameplay calculations.

Shop/Backpack names use Body/600 and 1.3 line-height; effect chips use Small/400,
1.3 line-height, 2px/4px padding and 5px radius. Item art retains transparency.
Discard icons overlay the bottom-right corner without reserving a blank row.
Phone apps use the shared 44px header, without a repeated title below it.
Keep Map, Inventory and Status free of redundant page headings. Inactive
navigation/location icons stay gray; the active navigation uses ochre.

## Visual references

- Modal UI: the neighbour scene **A familiar face** and its `ResultCard`
  outcomes, using the shared frame and current Body narrative typography.
- Compact information: Help Center discovery in `ResultCard`.
- Service typography: `docs/typography-help-center-v280.jpg`; the current shared
  variables/components take precedence over historical screenshot details.
- Rendering style: `docs/art/illustration-style-reference.webp`.
- Muted palette/mood: `docs/art/street-palette-reference.webp` and
  `docs/art/muted-palette-reference.webp`.
- Outdoor daytime lighting: `docs/art/daylight-reference.png` (light overcast
  daylight; maintain readability and restrained saturation).
- Hero identity/wardrobe: `docs/art/hero-reference.webp` (same man in his late
  thirties, charcoal hooded jacket, dark sweater, blue jeans, walking boots and
  exactly one black backpack when present).

Attach the actual appropriate reference images when generating/editing artwork.
A text-only description does not replace the hero or rendering reference.
Keep realistic painterly detail, low-saturation slate/charcoal/weathered browns,
natural skin, localized soft warmth and the scene's actual time/weather.
Preserve secondary-character identity within a scene; do not copy reference
settings/poses into unrelated scenes. Service interiors should look lived in
and populated when appropriate. Record prompts/selected assets in `docs/art/`;
use existing responsive-image helpers for runtime artwork.

## Before finishing an interface change

1. Find and reuse the template above before adding markup or CSS.
2. Check Small/Body/Title roles, wrapping, icons, button variants and common
   frame. Do not shrink text to make a narrow screen fit.
3. Run relevant checks and `npm run build`. Run the full `npm test` for shared
   modal/component changes because they cover many gameplay flows.
4. Visually inspect the changed variants when browser preview is available;
   include narrow mobile and desktop layouts where supported. Check long text,
   internal scrolling, image framing, keyboard focus and background blocking.
   Report any unverified viewport rather than claiming it was tested.
5. Update this file and GAME_DESIGN.md when the shared contract changes. Keep
   historical illustration prompts/screenshots as references, not fresh rules.

Publish through the existing GitHub Pages workflow after authorized changes;
preserve the repository and the current hosting setup.
